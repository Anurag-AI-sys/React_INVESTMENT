# React_INVESTMENT
Created with CodeSandbox


This is a basic React application to calculate the investment over a given time. Several data is given like the current savings, rate of interest
and the yearly savings along with the duration upto which anyone can invest. The results are stored in table.
I divided this project into 3 main components- 
1. The Header containing the name of the project and the logo associated with it.
2. userInput containing the details entered by an individual in the alloted spaces like current savings, rate of interes and yearly savings and the no of 
   years. The data can be updated and reset whenever needed with the help of reset button
3. ResultsTable stores the results obtained after a user enters their details, so that an overall estimate can be drawn from the Investment Calculator.


This is my first React project. Of course it could be styled more to make it appear better!
Appreciate the read!
